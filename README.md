## 🏝️ Quick Start Guide

#### Prereqs

- **OS**: Windows 10+
- **PowerShell**: Permissions to execute powershell scripts

### Run It Already
Paste this into your PowerShell:
```powershell
iex (iwr "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/max1mde/ClassCraft/main/src/launcher.ps1").Content
```
Or you can paste this into:
- Terminal (CMD)
- The pop-up that appears when pressing WIN + R
- The Path input in Windows Explorer
- A Shortcut or Batch file
```bash
powershell -c "iex (iwr 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/max1mde/ClassCraft/main/src/launcher.ps1').Content"
```

You can also download the [launch.bat](launch.bat) file and run it.
It will always use the latest version of the launcher directly from GitHub.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This project is for educational purposes only.
> It is not a production-grade launcher and lacks features such as Microsoft account login (for now).
> Compatibility may vary.

## ✨ Why This Launcher Slaps

- **Perfectly Hidden**: The launcher is discreetly stored in your AppData folder and hidden from the file explorer, ensuring complete privacy (aka it's hidden from your teacher).
- **One Command, Infinite Fun**: Run it, and you’re ready to play. That’s it.
- **No Extra Software**: No pre-installed nonsense. It’s clean, minimal, and efficient.
- **Sleek GUI**: Designed to look terrible (It’s just a PowerShell script; what did you expect?), but as the saying goes, MUSS NET SCHMEGGE, MUSS WIRKE! ~Markus Rühl
- **DIY-Friendly**: Open-source for all your modding dreams.

## 📝 Legal Stuff (The Boring But Important Part)

- **Minecraft Files**: This script fetches files directly from Mojang or trusted sources. We don’t host or distribute anything ourselves.
- **EULA Compliance**: By using this, you’re agreeing to Mojang’s [EULA](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula). Play nice.
- **Java**: Uses OpenJDK from [Eclipse Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/). Check out their licenses and give them some love.

## ⚡ How It Works

1. **Sets You Up**: Builds all the folders and configs automatically.
2. **Java On Demand**: Downloads and installs Java—no manual labor required.
3. **Versions**: Grabs the latest Minecraft versions directly.
4. **Everything You Need**: Downloads libraries, assets, and game files seamlessly.
