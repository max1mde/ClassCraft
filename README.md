## ✨ Why This Launcher Slaps

- **One Command, Infinite Fun**: Run it, and you’re ready to play. That’s it.
- **No Extra Software**: No pre-installed nonsense. It’s clean, minimal, and efficient.
- **Offline Mode**: Play even when the Wi-Fi gods are angry 😉.
- **Sleek GUI**: Sleek GUI: Designed to look terrible (It’s just a PowerShell script; what did you expect?), but as the saying goes, MUSS NET SCHMEGGE, MUSS WIRKE! ~Markus Rühl
- **DIY-Friendly**: Open-source for all your modding dreams.

## 📝 Legal Stuff (The Boring But Important Part)

- **Minecraft Files**: This script fetches files directly from Mojang or trusted sources. We don’t host or distribute anything ourselves.
- **EULA Compliance**: By using this, you’re agreeing to Mojang’s [EULA](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula). Play nice.
- **Java**: Uses OpenJDK from [Eclipse Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/). Check out their licenses and give them some love.

## ⚡ How It Works

1. **Sets You Up**: Builds all the folders and configs automatically.
2. **Java On Demand**: Downloads and installs Java—no manual labor required.
3. **Versions**: Grabs the latest Minecraft versions directly.
4. **Everything You Need**: Downloads libraries, assets, and game files seamlessly.
